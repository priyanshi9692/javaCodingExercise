// 274 H-Index
//Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
// write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
//
//        According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of
//        his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers
//        have no more than h citations each."
//
//        Example:
//
//        Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
//        Output: 3
//        Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
//        received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
//        Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
//        two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

                result = count;
            }else{
                break;
            }
        }
